# WikiRandom
Random Wikipedia articles. Exploring MVVM, RxSwift and Moya.

WikiRandom is a very simple app that displays snippets of random Wikipedia articles. The main goal with this project is to explore 3 topics:

#### 1) Moya
For networking, I like to use the Router design pattern suggested in Alamofire docs coupled with a custom class representing the web service. The router is used to manage endpoints in a type-safe way and is responsible for most things related to creating network requests. The custom web service class, in turn, is responsible for triggering requests and provides a clean interface that other parts of the app can use to make network requests and receive domain-specific model objects, instead of raw/json data. At its core, Moya seems to provide functionality similar to what you get with the router pattern, but Iâ€™m curious about it and how it would fit in or improve this setup.

#### 2) RxSwift
About time to give it a shot! Also related to 3).

#### 3) MVVM
MVC, as is often implemented in iOS, has some well-known shortcomings. Among the most popular alternative architectures, MVVM looks very promising. Especially with RxSwift for the bindings.
